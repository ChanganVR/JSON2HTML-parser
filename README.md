This program can be run by command ":run main", where input file name and output file name will be "input.json" and "output.html"
Also, it can run with one argument, which is the name of input file, i.e., ":run main input.json", where "input.json" can be replaced by name of input file.
And it can run with two argument given, which are the name of input and output files, correspondingly. For example, ":run main input.json output.html".
